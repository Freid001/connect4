# Connect4
University project to build a connect4 game using VB.NET

## About
* A university project built in [Visual Studios](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and using VB.NET. 
* For this Project I worked in a group to create a Connect 4 game in VB.NET. This involved working with others to produce a project plan, design requirements, pseudo code, documentation, test cases and a VB.NET application.
* Due to copyright restrictions I am only permitted to share the compiled programe.
