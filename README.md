# Connect4
University project to build a connect4 game using VB.NET

## About
* A university project built in [Visual Studios](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and using VB.NET. 
* For this Project I assumed the primary implementer role, whilst working in a group to create a Connect 4 game in VB.NET. This involved working with others to produce a project plan, design requirements/pseudo code, user guides, maintenances documentation, code and testing. I gained a lot from this experience whilst using skills learnt from pervious Visual Studios exercises and courseworks in order to develop and learn new skills. I enjoying working in a team and found that this particular project highlighted the importance of deadlines, time management and dependency on other team members.
* Due to copyright restrictions I am only permitted to share the compiled programes.
